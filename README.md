Smart Trap
=========

Smart Trap is a high-tech, non-lethal mouse trap. It uses a passive infrared sensor to detect when a mouse has entered. The trap then automatically pushes the notification data to the cloud that will sync with the android application. The user will be notified of the mouse capture on the app on their mobile device and can then take the trap outside and release the mouse. Release can be done either remotely from the application or by pressing a switch on the trap. Once the mouse leaves the trap, the user will be notified, and the trap can then be brought back inside to be setup again.
